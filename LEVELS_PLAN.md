# Learning Mode Level Plan

This document outlines a simple approach to themed levels for the learning mode.
Each group of levels focuses on vocabulary categories so players gradually build
their knowledge.

## Level Groups

1. **Food Words** – Levels 1–3
   - Words related to meals, snacks and basic ingredients.
2. **Drinks** – Levels 4–5
   - Beverages like tea, water and juice.
3. **Animals** – Levels 6–8
   - Common animals and pets.
4. **Places & Transportation** – Levels 9–11
   - Locations around town and methods of travel.
5. **Adjectives & Feelings** – Levels 12–14
   - Descriptive words and emotions.
6. **Seasonal Terms** – Levels 15–16
   - Weather and seasonal vocabulary.

Each level can specify a target score or a list of required words from that
category. Completing the objectives unlocks the next stage.

Further themes can be added using the existing `wordsInfo` database to keep
expanding the curriculum.
